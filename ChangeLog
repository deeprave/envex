1.1.2

- ensure that env_path is resolved before updating $PWD

1.1.1

- updated $PWD/$CWD handling again, set these rather than setdefault to override possible
  values from the shell to provide more consistent results

1.1.0

- updated implied $PWD handling:
    - $CWD is setdefault for the process current directory (this was previously $PWD)
    - $PWD is setdefault for the directory containing the .env file
- errors: bool arg load_env and friends, defaults to False
    - if errors=True, FileNotFoundError is raised when no usable .env ($DOTENV) file is found
